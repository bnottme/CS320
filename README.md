How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Before coding the program, I start by writing unit tests to validate the behavior of individual functions, methods, and classes. This ensures that each component works as intended. I also prioritize security throughout the development process by implementing input validation to prevent malicious data, authentication, and using encryption to protect sensitive information.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I carefully analyze user requirements to understand their needs and expectations. I translate these requirements into specific features and functionalities within the program. While developing the program, I continuously consider security, ensuring that user data and interactions are protected. I focus on creating a user-centric design that aligns with stakeholders' needs and expectations.

How do I approach designing software?

Throughout the design process, I seek feedback from stakeholders and peers, iterating on the design to continuously improve it. I remain open to refining the design, ensuring the final product is effective and secure.
